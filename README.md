# Procurement-Software

This project visualizes local procurement (companies by service type) and BESS projects from an Excel workbook on an interactive map. The map can switch between 2D and 3D views using CesiumJS with OpenStreetMap tiles. Weather data is fetched from the free Open-Meteo API. The goal is to create an interactive map which displays a marker over the county capital and lists all the service type followed by company name and notes. The 'Contact' column displays a hyperlink that redirects you to a google search of the company (=HYPERLINK("https://www.google.com/search?q=" & ENCODEURL(C2 & " contact information"), "Contact Information")) and not precise contact information. The 'location on google maps' column does the same =HYPERLINK("https://www.google.com/maps/search/" & ENCODEURL(C3 & ", " & A3 & " County, California"), "Link to Google Maps"). These contact and location on google maps hyperlinks should allow the user to be rerouted to the companies google search.
